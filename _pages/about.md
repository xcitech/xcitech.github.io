Hey I'm Rajarshi, currently a PhD student @ University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am working with Prof. Rob Deconto in the Climate System Research Center. I am passionate about Data, Visualizations, Modeling and Coding.

When I'm not coding for my research, I am working on projects using open source data, writing tutorials to share what I learn or taking photographs.

You can also check my <a href="http://xcitech.github.io" target="blank">portfolio</a> if you'd like to see my photographs :).
